## Close Up

Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kadir.

I was born and bred in TÃ¼rkiye ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·


I've lived in many cities so far. Getting to know different cultures was a good experience for me.

I live in Istanbul and plan to stay here for a while. It is the most populous European city and is cosmopolitan. Everything in this city moves at breakneck speed (even the turtles ðŸ˜„)

## Favorites

## Hobies

### Cooking

Cooking is like going on a journey for me. I love trying and tasting new recipes. My mom is a role model for me at this point. I have a lot of trust and respect for her hand flavor. Also she has a small restaurant at Bursa [@gulevyemekleri16](https://www.instagram.com/gulevyemekleri16)

### CrossFit

It makes me physically stronger and more resilient. Working with my friends and coaches are very enjoyable. Workouts are different every day.

Thanks a lot to my dear gym [@crossfitaspera](https://www.instagram.com/crossfitaspera)

### Preparing Gifts

It's important to me to think about the other person. I love giving gifts to my loved ones. Also, not just on special days like birthdays but any day.

When I give them a gift they are often surprised and ask "what happened?". I say "nothing happened". They slowly get used to this situation.


## Important Points

- Respecting for people, animals and other things

- Not making fun of someone

- Using time efficiently

- Don't care about these:
    - How much do you weigh?
    - How much is your salary?
    - Which political party do you support?
    - Which religion you belong to?
    - What is your sexual orientation?
      ight or overweight. Religion, political beliefs, and sexual orientation can all differ.

What does it matter?

These mean nothing to me.
