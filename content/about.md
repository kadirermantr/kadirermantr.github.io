## Hobies

### Cooking

Cooking is like going on a journey for me. I love trying and tasting new recipes. My mom is a role model for me at this point. I have a lot of trust and respect for her hand flavor. Also she has a small restaurant at Bursa [@gulevyemekleri16](https://www.instagram.com/gulevyemekleri16)

## Important Points

- Respecting for people, animals and other things

- Not making fun of someone

- Using time efficiently

- Don't care about these:
    - How much do you weigh?
    - How much is your salary?
    - Which political party do you support?
    - Which religion you belong to?
    - What is your sexual orientation?
      ight or overweight. Religion, political beliefs, and sexual orientation can all differ.

What does it matter?

These mean nothing to me.
